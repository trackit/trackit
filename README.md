## Web UI

A Web UI made with React is available here: [TrackIt Client](https://github.com/trackit/trackit2-client)

## API documentation

The API exposes its own documentation on the `GET /docs` route, in JSON format.
Also, the documentation for each route can be retrieved by an `OPTIONS`
request. We are working on an actual viewer for this.

## Recommendation plugins

Trackit uses a plugin system to easily implement new recommendation checks.
Informations on how to write plugins are available in a README in the `plugins` directory.
